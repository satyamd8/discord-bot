# Discord Bot ðŸ¤–
A discord bot with a multitude of features including a music player. Can serve as a template for different types of bots. (Coded in Python using discord.py API)

## Features â›²
- Music player that plays any YouTube link (using yt-dlp)
- Logs message edit history with before and after message
- Moderation commands (kick, ban)
- Fun interactive slash commands (roll, embed, more to come)
- Access to real-time weather data (using OpenWeatherMap API)

## Installation ðŸ’½
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Make sure to create your own **.env** file to store your bot token, weather API, and other APIs you plan to use
   This is done to keep your tokens private, preventing others from having access to it (if you plan to host it somewhere public)

   Make sure to create tokens (in the .env) for WEATHER, ICON, GIF1, GIF2, GIF3, and GIF4 (some commands may not function properly without these variables set)
