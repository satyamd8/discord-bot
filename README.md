# Discord Bot
A simple discord bot with a multitude of features. Can serve as a template for different types of bots.

## Features
- Logs message edit history with before and after message
- Moderation commands (kick, ban)
- Fun interactive slash commands (roll, embed, more to come)
- Access to real-time weather data (using OpenWeatherMap API)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Make sure to create your own **.env** file to store your bot token, weather API, and other APIs you plan to use
   This is done to keep your tokens private, preventing others from having access to it (if you plan to host it somewhere public)
